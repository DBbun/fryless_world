## What It Does
The Fryless World Generator creates large-scale synthetic datasets simulating
economic, environmental, and culinary responses to a fictional 2029 event:
the global disappearance of French fries.

It produces:
- `fryless_timeseries.csv` — monthly indicators per location  
- `fryless_innovations.csv` — adoption & sustainability experiments  
- `fryless_events.csv` — shock and response events  
- `fryless_datadict.json` — dataset summary

All data are **synthetic and original** — ideal for AI/ML demos, visualization,
and storytelling applications.
